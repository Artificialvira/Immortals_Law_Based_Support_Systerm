### Description
This project demonstrates a prototype for a legal chatbot system designed to empower individuals with basic knowledge of their rights in various situations.
### What it does?
* Users can interact with the chatbot through a user-friendly interface built with React.
* They can submit legal queries via text prompts, offering accessibility for diverse users.
* The backend, powered by FastAPI, leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the legal context of the user's query.
* By analyzing keywords and phrases, the chatbot identifies the relevant legal scenario.
* Utilizing a pre-built knowledge base, the system generates clear and concise explanations of rights and obligations in plain language.
* Additionally, the chatbot offers links to trusted legal resources, such as government websites or legal aid organizations, for further      exploration.
* Importantly, the system includes disclaimers emphasizing the chatbot's limitations and encouraging users to seek professional legal advice for complex situations.
